    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pilau has a wonderful balance of flavors. It is a festive dish, which is never missing during special occasions or events. It’s made with rice cooked in a well-seasoned broth of Meat or chicken. Unlike the Indian pilau, the East African version does not use curry and it’s less spicy.
       Rice is, without a doubt, one of my favorite food in the world. Not only is it my to-go dish when I need to prepare a quick meal, but it can easily be turned into an elegant dish for special occasions.With the right combination of spices, plain rice can be turned into the main attraction
       like this Rice Pilau or the West African jollof rice, my go-to one-pot chicken and rice, and much more!
